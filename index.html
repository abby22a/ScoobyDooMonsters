<p> The Mystery Inc. gang features teen detectives and a dog: Scooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne, Fred, and sometimes Scrappy Doo. The gang entertainingly solves mysteries and unmasks rivals on <i>Scooby Doo! Where Are You!</i> television show and films beginning back in 1969. The show was created during the Vietnam War to elevate political tension and create a humorous, family friendly outlet for people of all ages. 
“The one thing that unites all the generations from Gen X to Gen Z is their shared love for Scooby-doo. You might not know the lyrics of the theme song unlike others who have the groovy words engraved in their memory (like myself), but you would definitely recognize the tune of Scooby-doo even from a mile away. As kids, we owed a lot of our good night’s sleep or lack of to these meddling kids for debunking myths about creepy villains and ghosts. At the end of every episode, our favorite, the Mystery Inc. would unmask the person pretending to be a ghost.” Some episodes are more spooky than others and this website focuses on the top 10 spookiest Scooby Doo Villains. “The reason why this cartoon remains iconic is that it gave us characters we can relate to. Velma and Shaggy assured us that it is okay to be different. Velma has been a role model to the kids who felt too geeky, unable to fit in. It is her intellect alongside Shaggy and Scooby’s impeccable timing that always saves the day. Shaggy’s ever-hungry hipster persona is a contrast to that of Fred and Daphne’s. Fred and Daphne are portrayed as mature and responsible enough to be adults. Like the popular saying goes; great art is inspired in times of crisis." </p>
