<p> The Mystery Inc. gang features teen detectives and a dog: Scooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne, Fred, and sometimes Scrappy Doo. The gang entertainingly solves mysteries and unmasks rivals on <i>Scooby Doo! Where Are You!</i> television show and films beginning back in 1969. The show was created during the Vietnam War to elevate political tension and create a humorous, family friendly outlet for people of all ages. 
<p><q cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m56I0XorJw">The one thing that unites all the generations from Gen X to Gen Z is their shared love for Scooby-doo. You might not know the lyrics of the theme song unlike others who have the groovy words engraved in their memory (like myself), but you would definitely recognize the tune of Scooby-doo even from a mile away. As kids, we owed a lot of our good night’s sleep or lack of to these meddling kids for debunking myths about creepy villains and ghosts. At the end of every episode, our favorite, the Mystery Inc. would unmask the person pretending to be a monster.</q></p>

    <p> Some episodes are more spooky than others and this website focuses on the top 10 spookiest Scooby Doo Villains. <p><q cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m56I0XorJw">The reason why this cartoon remains iconic is that it gave us characters we can relate to. Velma and Shaggy assured us that it is okay to be different. Velma has been a role model to the kids who felt too geeky, unable to fit in. It is her intellect alongside Shaggy and Scooby’s impeccable timing that always saves the day. Shaggy’s ever-hungry hipster persona is a contrast to that of Fred and Daphne’s. Fred and Daphne are portrayed as mature and responsible enough to be adults. Like the popular saying goes; great art is inspired in times of crisis." </q></p>

    The Ghost of Dr. Coffin
       -"The Ghost of Dr. Coffin had pale skin, pointy ears and green sclera. He had no hair on his head. He wore an oversized laboratory shirt with tattered sleeves, a white brimless cap, and long, grey rubber gloves. It is unknown if this is how the actual Dr. Coffin looked like or if the costume has been altered."
   <br>
    The Space Kook
        -"It appeared to be a ghostly apparition of a humanoid inside of a blue spacesuit. A skull was visible through the helmet, with dull yellow eyes set inside black sockets. The "background" of the creature's space helmet was entirely dark but occasionally glowed in a sinister red hue whenever the creature laughed."
    <br>
    The Phantom Puppeteer
        -"Pietro's face mask made it look like he had pale-grayish skin and yellow sclera. He wore a black cavalier hat, a dark-gray cloak, with a high collar, which is red inside. He also wore dress shoes, which matched the outside of his cloak. He wore plain black pants which were mostly covered by his cloak, and gray gloves."
   <br>
    The Phantom Shadows
        -"The Phantom Shadows wore blue robes with hoods over their heads shadowing their faces. They are able to shoot blue fireballs and hover off the ground."
  <br>
    The Ghost Clown
        -"The Ghost Clown has the appearance of a stereotypical clown; a silly costume, red hair and white make up on his face with a pink nose and lips. What separates him from a normal clown, is the evil grin on his face, his yellow eyes and his black eyeshadow. Along with his criminal reputation of stealing and laughing creepily."
  <br>
    The Headless Horseman
        -"It is a headless male body with an orange, carved pumpkin for a head. He wears a dark blue outfit, white gloves, a dark blue cape and gray boots."
  <br>
    The Ghostly Gondolier
        -"He was a humanoid ghost creature with green sclera and black pupils. His mouth also glowed green. He wore an indigo tunic with a grey cloak, dark gray gloves and knee-high grey boots with a matching grey belt. His face cannot be seen when in disguise. The Ghostly Gondolier is very sinister. He is tricky and will do anything to collect all 4 medallions. He also seems to be athletic in a way as he swings from ropes. The Ghostly Gondolier has one of the most sinister personalities and laugh in Scooby-Doo as a whole."
   <br>
    The Skull Island Vampire
        -"Gramps was a pale male, with black hair and a beard without a moustache, yellow sclera, fangs, and pointed ears. He wore a magenta cape with a purple interior, an indigo tuxedo, a gray dress shirt and a magenta bow tie. He was vengeful and cruel towards the gang as well as Scooby Doo and he also had habit of making panther-like sounds and screaming for blood to scare the gang. He would also laugh sinisterly when things went his way."
   <br>
    The Creeper
        -"The Creeper was a costume resembling a green-skinned phantom/zombie with a hunchback posture, dark red hair, yellow eye sclera, and a somewhat lopsided face with prominent cheekbones and a long jawbone. He wore a dark green trench coat with matching dark green pants, a black inner shirt and black shoes.He had a violent temper, as shown when he brutally beat up a bank guard. He also didn't appear to be very smart, as he fell for Scooby-Doo's incredibly obvious hen disguise."
  <br>
    The Tar Monster
        -"The Tar Monster was a large, green-eyed cyclops made of simulated melting tar. He basically just growled and roared as he chased after any intruders. The Tar Monster only had the ability to swim through tar, which was because it had a diving suit underneath."
